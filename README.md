## About Project
This is the Capstone Project of the Data Scientist Nano Degree Course from Udacity. In this project, we try to explore the factors affecting user churn with Pyspark. Then we will use the pyspark.ml package to build a machine learning model with the factors we identified to see how well can we predict churn.

## About Dataset
The dataset we are using in this project is provided by Udacity. It is generated by a pseudo music streaming service provider Sparkify. The full dataset is 12GB, for this project, we will use a a tiny subset dataset which is 128M
