## Terminology
- **Customer churn rate** is the proportion of contractual customers or subscribers who leave a supplier during a given time period.

- **CLV**: Customer Lifetime Value

- **A user day** is defined as one day that a user remained active.

## Why user churn matters
- The probability of selling to an existing customer is 60-70%, but only 5-20% for a prospect
- Churn rate is a health indicator for businesses whose customers are subscribers and paying for services on a recurring basis
- The most innovative firms are using churn rate analysis as an opportunity to get ahead of losing customers rather than just accept it
- Looking at churn rates by customer segment illuminates which types of customers are at risk and which may require an intervention
- look at churn at a segment level (like by age), data-rich firms are also starting to look at the number on an individual customer level
- not only understand what happened in the last period, but also to predict what’s going to happen in the next



## Churn Rate Forumla
To calculate customer churn rate, designate a time period and tally up the total number of customers you've acquired and the number of customers who churned during that time period. Then, divide the number of customers who churned by the total number of customers acquired, and multiply that decimal by 100% to calculate your churn rate.

## Steps to calculate churn rate:

- Determine a time period.
- Determine the number of customers acquired in this time period. 
- Determine the number of customers lost or churned in this time period. 
- Divide the number of lost customers by the number of acquired customers.
- Multiply that number by 100%.

## Causes of churn
- cost
- poor onboarding experience
- poor user interface or user experience
- lack of features
- competitor products
- poor product/ market fit
- lost value perception of the app
- top 3 reasons for uninstalling are: no longer using the app, a lack of storage space, and too much advertising in the app
- dealer seeker, more likely to churn, wrong kinds of customers

## Churn rate benchmark

- Across iOS and Android, worldwide retention after 90 days is just 4%.
- 90% of people who install an app will abandon it within a month.
- Just 24% of users accessed an app one day after first use
- The average Android app loses 80% of daily active users within 3 days after install.
- **what's the churn rate for app that make revenue**
- baseline churn rate

- What are we as a company doing to cause customer turnover? 
- What are our customers doing that’s contributing to their leaving?
- How can we better manage our customer relationships to make sure it doesn’t happen?
- Where are we losing our users after onboarding?
- What do they do prior to becoming inactive?
- How frequently does a user visit?
- Which users clicked on a specific campaign?

## Strategies to reduce customer churn
#### 1. Analyze churn when it happens to improve customer service.

#### 2. Start customers off on the right foot.

Use a new customer welcome email, dedicated 1:1 and online customer onboarding, and create educational content on your blog, social media, and video channels to instruct customers and show them how to get optimal value from your product or service.

#### 3. Invest in more training for support and sales reps. 

#### 4. Ask for feedback at key moments – and respond promptly.

#### 5. Communicate proactively with customers. 

#### 6. Cohort Analysis
- Acquisition Channel (Where are your most successful users coming from? Search, social, paid ads, referral, etc.)
- Action (What actions do your most successful users take? Create an account, create a playlist, add 5 friends, etc.)
- Time (How long does it take your most successful users to complete those actions? An hour, a day, a week?)
- **Acquisition Cohorts:** Group users by the day, week, or month that they first downloaded your app. By measuring retention for each of these cohorts, you can determine how long people are using your app and where you’re losing them.
- **Behavioral Cohorts**: Group users by the specific behaviors they have (or haven’t) taken in your app within a given time frame. (For example, App Install, App Launch, Complete User Profile, Add a Friend, Complete a Purchase, etc., — or any combination of these actions.)

## Notes

- actionable insights
- Behavioral analytics
- Make it stick, hook your users
- If churn is your only measure of customer happiness, then you’re always six months too late to influence your future.
- There is no magic number for churn rate, it depends
- which users are at risk to churn either downgrading from premium to free tier or cancelling their service altogether
